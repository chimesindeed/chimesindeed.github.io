#### Four months down the road in my Software Engineering journey and echoes of phrases such as "Separation of Concerns" and "RESTful Routes" circled at the outskirts of my mind.  One thing I was learning slowly was that, at least in Ruby and Ruby Specific Languages, many conventions and best practices existed for the sanity of the developer.  Project 2 was to be written in Sinatra, (a Domain Specific Language built on top of Ruby) and had to give the user C.R.U.D. functionality on app data which would be persisted in a database.
#### NameDaPlace was the name of the app, and part of the pitch was:
> NameDaPlace gives you the capacity to create, store, retrieve and update data that's meaningful to you... places that you want to remember.
> E.g. A coffee spot, tailor, date place, laundry spot, museum. You name it!
#### Signup functionality was part of the requirements as well as password authentication. So, many users can use NameDaPlace and have access to their records alone. Session authentication was added as well so that state from one page to another could be maintained and equality checks could be implemented throughout to verify that a user could only see and manipulate his or her own data even if a Url was entered that pointed to another user's data.
### At this point in our training Active Record had been introduced for Object Relational Mapping with which Ruby Models could be mapped to objects stored in our database.
#### Memorizing and implementing Ruby, Embedded Ruby, Sinatra games of catch between Controllers and Views, while retrieving and pushing the correct data to a database via Active Record integrated Models, was a lot to wrap my head around. Its pretty neat though running numerous equality checks to ensure that a user's data remains in an isolated environment. Another fun things was that while coding this assignment I began to get an idea of what was going on under the hood when going to a web page and interacting with it.
#### As a relatively new coder I can say that a takaway from this process is that - the feeling of hitting a brick wall while coding, which happens a lotâ€¦is balanced out by the technologies learned, cool concepts learned, and enjoyment in them. Programming is an enormous world and with determination and discipline, I can easily see myself and other students having fun things to do and think about for the next 2 to 3 decades.
