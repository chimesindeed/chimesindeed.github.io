### Thus far - the Immersive had used the Ruby language to get students' feet wet with a CLI App, and then progressed to Sinatra, a relatively lightweight framework with which students were pushed to implement database and C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. I was 6 months down "Ruby Red Road" so to speak, and now I found myself face to face with our 3rd project due.

### Project 3 was to be written using Ruby on Rails.  We'd been coding, doing labs, attending study groups and-one-on-ones via Zoom conferencing with faculty and fellow cohort students for 6 months and it was now expected of us that our code be sufficiently D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) and demonstrate efficiently the use of concepts such as Abstraction and Separation of Concerns.

### For our Rails Project - I imagined I worked as part of a team of developers, and a Client came to us requesting that we create an app that would help them with a Children’s Book they wanted to write. The book was to have a single page for each letter of the alphabet in order. So regarding the letters themselves, there would be 26 pages starting with A, ending with Z.
### Each page was to include -->
> The pages letter, e.g. 'A'.
> 
> A key word that started with pages letter, e.g. 'Amazing'.
>  
> A single phrase incorporating letter and word.
### So an example page would read:
> A is for Amazing Grace.

### Project 3 would present the Client with options to:
### Create words.  Create phrases.  Connect words with phrases -- 

### I would want to give the Client C. R. U. D. functionality on Words, so if they thought of a cool word for their book, they could fire up Wednesday and store it.  But wait...maybe while on Wednesday for brief seconds only, they had a Phrase in mind when they were thinking of the word, so right in front of them I would want them to have displayed buttons / menus enabling C. R. U. D. functionality on Phrases.  In order to help them brainstorm it would be important to display creative opitions on screen with which they could manipulate their creative space in front of them.  In case pressing buttons was fun, or seeing what all their options were before they got on with their day, on their screen would be the option of - Word Index - to see all their words...- Phrase index - to see all their phrases, and some sort of view where they could see any words they had matched with their Phrases.  Like a ‘Match / Completed Page’ Menu that could give them a feeling of accomplishment.  I also wouldn’t want to give them too much functionality that would take away from their goal....like I wouldn’t want to put a button on there where they could pop up a game of Tetris, although that would be kinda fun.  However, maybe on every page I could have their Goal displayed.
### Wednesday greets the Client with a main page where they can login / signup with email or with their Github account.  They have separate options of creating words, creating phrases, updating words, updating phrases, and viewing indexes of each along with the ability to delete any element.  Future versions may include an open source rhyming dictionary to help the Client thread rhymes throughout the progression of letters.  Maybe future additions could include a model for possible illustrations . . . .
